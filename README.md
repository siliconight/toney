# Toney

A JUCE-based **AU / VST3 / Standalone** mastering chain plugin: passive program
EQ + variable-mu compressor + dynamic EQ + tape stage + dynamic resonance
suppressor, driven from a single interactive spectrum display.

> **Name placeholder.** "Toney" is a generic working name. Pick your own
> before publishing - see [Renaming](#renaming) below.

## What it does

A single-canvas mastering processor with five stages in series. Default chain:

```
[ Program EQ  <->  Vari-Mu Comp ]  ->  Dynamic EQ  ->  Tape  ->  Resonance Suppressor  ->  Output
```

The EQ and compressor pair can be swapped with the routing arrow in the
header. Every stage can be bypassed independently via its chain pill.

### Program EQ
A four-band passive-style topology: low-frequency boost shelf and cut shelf
that share a stepped frequency selector (20 / 30 / 60 / 100 Hz), high-frequency
peak with adjustable bandwidth (3 / 4 / 5 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 16 kHz), and a
high-frequency cut shelf (5 / 10 / 20 kHz). Followed by a tube-style soft
saturation drive stage.

### Variable-mu compressor
Stereo-linked, peak-detected, with input gain that drives both the signal and
the detector. The "ratio" rises with level rather than being a fixed knob -
soft onset, grabby when pushed. Six time-constant positions; positions 5 and 6
have program-dependent release (fast initial release, slow tail after sustained
gain reduction).

### Dynamic EQ
Three fully-independent bands. Each has its own bandpass sidechain (the band
only reacts to its own frequency content), with target gain, threshold,
attack, release. Positive gain = upward dynamic, negative = downward.

### Tape
Drive into asymmetric tanh saturation, low-frequency head bump, high-frequency
rolloff, output trim. Three speed presets retune the bump and rolloff.

### Dynamic resonance suppressor
24 narrow bandpass filters log-spaced 200 Hz - 14 kHz. Each band's envelope is
compared against the spatial average of its four nearest neighbors; bands
sticking up above the neighborhood by more than `Threshold` dB are attenuated
up to `Depth` dB. Off by default - destructive opt-in processing.

## Interface

- **Header.** Five chain pills + routing arrow + global output + master
  bypass. Click any pill to toggle that stage. Click the arrow to flip EQ/Comp
  routing direction.
- **Spectrum view.** Log-frequency horizontal axis (20 Hz - 20 kHz), dB
  vertical axis. Live FFT of the plugin output drawn translucent behind a
  cream EQ-response curve.
- **Draggable handles.** Each EQ band - four static, three dynamic - is a dot
  on the curve.
  - Drag vertical = gain. Drag horizontal = frequency. Mouse wheel = Q (where
    applicable).
  - The program EQ handles snap to the stepped frequency selectors as you drag.
  - Dynamic-band handles have a halo whose radius and alpha track live
    activity in real time.
- **Module grid.** 2x2 below the spectrum: Dynamics inspector | Compressor |
  Tape | Resonance suppressor.

## Build & install for Logic Pro

### Prerequisites

- macOS 11 (Big Sur) or newer
- Xcode 14+ with command-line tools: `xcode-select --install`
- CMake 3.22+: `brew install cmake`

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<this-repo>.git Toney
cd Toney
bash build.sh
```

That script:

1. Configures a universal-binary (Apple Silicon + Intel) Xcode project
2. Builds Release
3. Copies the AU to `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/Toney.component`
   and the VST3 to `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/Toney.vst3`
4. Runs `auval -v aufx Pteq Yorc` (same validation Logic uses internally)

### Open it in Logic

1. Open Logic Pro
2. **Logic Pro -> Settings -> Plug-In Manager**
3. Find **Toney** in the list. If it's red, click **Reset & Rescan
   Selection**.
4. Close the manager. The plugin is now under **Audio FX -> YourCompany ->
   Toney** on any channel.

If Logic doesn't see it at all, clear the AU cache and force a rescan:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/AudioUnitCache
killall -9 AudioComponentRegistrar 2>/dev/null
```

then reopen Logic.

### Renaming

The 4-character codes `Pteq` / `Yorc` and the name "Toney" are
placeholders. Edit `CMakeLists.txt` to publish under your own name:

```cmake
COMPANY_NAME             "YourActualName"
BUNDLE_ID                "com.yourname.yourpluginname"
PLUGIN_MANUFACTURER_CODE Abcd     # any unique 4-char, >=1 uppercase
PLUGIN_CODE              Wxyz     # any unique 4-char, >=1 uppercase
PRODUCT_NAME             "Your Plugin Name"
```

Codes must be unique across all AUs on the user's machine - if two plugins
share a code, Logic will reject one of them.

### CI builds via GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds a universal-binary AU + VST3 on every
push and on any tag matching `v*`. It validates the AU with `auval` and
uploads the bundles as a `Toney-macOS.zip` workflow artifact. Tag pushes
also create a GitHub Release with the zip attached.

## Implementation notes

- **Oversampling.** The EQ tube saturation and the tape saturation each run
  inside their own `juce::dsp::Oversampling` (2x FIR halfband, linear phase,
  `useIntegerLatency=true`). Oversamplers run unconditionally so reported
  latency stays constant whether stages are bypassed or driven. Linear
  filters run at native rate. Total latency is ~18 samples at 44.1 kHz
  (~0.4 ms), reported via `setLatencySamples`.
- **Dynamic EQ topology.** Each band uses `output = input + (G - 1) *
  activeAmount * BP(input)` - parallel BP-and-add. Lets the gain modulate at
  audio rate without re-cooking biquad coefficients. Good approximation of a
  peaking biquad for moderate gain/Q; diverges at very deep cuts with very
  narrow Q.
- **Resonance suppressor topology.** Same parallel BP-and-add but with
  negative gain, applied across 24 fixed bandpass filters whose envelopes
  are compared spatially (band vs neighborhood) each sample.
- **FFT analyzer.** Single-producer / single-consumer ring buffer. Audio
  thread writes mono-summed samples; UI thread (30 Hz timer) reads the
  latest 2048 samples, windows, FFTs, and updates smoothed dB magnitudes
  with fast-rise / slow-fall ballistics.
- **No malware/anti-features.** Standalone build, no telemetry, no network
  calls (`JUCE_USE_CURL=0`, `JUCE_WEB_BROWSER=0`).
